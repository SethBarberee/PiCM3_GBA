# Pi-Compute-3-Lite-BLANK
Blank Kicad schematic for using the Pi CM3L.

The schematic will require some custom parts that are included in the .lib files. Custom libraries can be linked to in Kicad. The schematic contains everything required to get the CM3L to run. The rest of the pins are free to be used for any project. These files are meant to help jumpstart a project that wants to build around the CM3L.
